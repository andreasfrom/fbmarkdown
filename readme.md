fbmarkdown - Facebook Markdown
------------------------------
This is a Google Chrome extension that enables the usage of [Markdown][md] syntax on Facebook.

Newlines are preserved to avoid disrupting the formatting of other peoples' status updates.

# Screenshots
When writing the update:

![Before](https://raw.github.com/andreasfrom/fbmarkdown/master/before.png)

And after it's been sent and parsed:

![After](https://raw.github.com/andreasfrom/fbmarkdown/master/after.png)

It's possible to toggle between source and html by doubleclicking it:

# Usage
Just install the extension to start using it.
Updates, comments, and chat messages are parsed automatically.

When entering code, by indenting it 4 spaces, it's also highlighted for you after posting.

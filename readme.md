fbmarkdown - Facebook Markdown
------------------------------
This is a Google Chrome extension that enables the usage of [Markdown][md] syntax on Facebook.

Newlines are preserved to avoid disrupting the formatting of other peoples' status updates.

[md]: http://www.daringfireball.com/projects/markdown/

# Screenshots
When writing the update:

![Before]()

And after it's been sent and parsed:

![After]()

It's possible to toggle between source and html by doubleclicking it:

![Source]()

# Usage
Just install the extension to start using it.
Updates, comments, and chat messages are parsed automatically.

When entering code, by indenting it 4 spaces, it's also highlighted for you after posting.
